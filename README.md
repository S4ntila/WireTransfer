WireTransfer integrates with the Central Bank of Russia API to obtain current exchange rates:

```python
def get_eur_rub():
    response = requests.get("https://www.cbr-xml-daily.ru/daily_json.js")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        eur_rub = data["Valute"]["EUR"]["Value"]
        return float(eur_rub)
    else:
        return None
```

Custom rates are calculated based on this data:
- Buy rate: CBR rate √ó 1.053
- Sell rate: CBR rate √ó 0.99

## Security

### Data Protection

### Access Control

- Role-based permissions for admin functions
- Multi-step verification for critical operations
- Restricted review capabilities

## Data Management

### Storage System

WireTransfer uses four JSON files for data persistence:

1. `users_id.json`: Records multiple completed transactions with array storage
2. `users_id_review.json`: Tracks users who have submitted reviews
3. `reviews.json`: Stores approved user reviews
4. `reviews_confirm.json`: Stores pending reviews awaiting approval

### Data Formats

Example user storage format:
```json
{
  "user_ids": [123456789, 987654321, 456789123]
}
```

Example review storage format:
```json
{
  "123456789": ["‚úÖ @username: Great service, fast exchange! Very satisfied.\n"]
}
```
